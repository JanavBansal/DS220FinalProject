# DS220FinalProject
# Roulette Game Analysis using Data Science
This project analyzes 100,000 rounds of roulette data to uncover patterns, probabilities, and betting strategies. Using Python's data science libraries, we explore various aspects of the game to understand its mathematical nature and investigate different betting approaches.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Simulated Roulette Game Data
- **Size**: 100,000 rounds
- **Features**:
  - Round number
  - Winning number (0-36)
  - Winning color (Red, Black, Green)
  - Bet outcomes (Red, Black,Green, Even, Odd, Zero)

## Analysis Questions
1. How do observed color probabilities compare to theoretical probabilities?
2. What patterns exist in winning streaks for different bet types?
3. How do different betting strategies affect bankroll over time?
4. Is there any bias in the distribution of winning numbers?
5. What is the frequency of color alternation?
6. How effective are different betting systems over extended periods?

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and presentation

## Key Findings
- Color probabilities align with theoretical expectations
- No exploitable patterns in number distribution
- Betting systems cannot overcome house edge
- Streak patterns follow expected random distribution
- Color alternation rates match theoretical probability
